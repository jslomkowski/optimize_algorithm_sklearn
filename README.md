# Optimize algorithm sklearn

Simple repo showing how you can optimize the machine learning model using linear programming instead of going through the hyperparameter optimization process

## Required packages

```sh
pip install pandas scipy scikit-learn
```

In Windows, you can also install all packages I use with environment.yml provided

```sh
conda env update --file environment.yml
```

## Usage example

Simply execute

```sh
python optimize_algorithm_sklearn.py
```
